# Design of my own relational database

## Structure of this repository
This repository contains both the documentation needed to know how our database is designed (**doc** folder) and the source code (**code** folder) to actually implement it. This work is not only mine but also was done along with my others three class mates whose names appear in the documentation.

## How we made it
